## Summary

Web front- and backend for an e-commerce platform utilizing DDD principles based on an [existing cookiecutter template](https://github.com/MGTheTrain/dotnet-ddd-web-api-starter) for [the web backend](./backend/Mgtt.ECom/)

## Features

- **User Management**
  - User Registration & Authentication
    - [x] Securely handle user sign-up, login, and role management.
    - [x] Communicate with IAM provider APIs like Auth0.

  - Review Moderation
    - [ ] Manage and moderate user reviews to maintain quality and trustworthiness. Therefore leverage OpenAI APIs.

- **Optimizations**
  - [ ] Reduce the number of web backend calls from the web frontend by providing HTTP endpoints that perform multiple logical backend operations
  - [ ] Decompose monolith web backend into ÂµServices
  - [ ] Implement filtering and pagination for specific list calls in web backend
  - [ ] Increase and measure code coverage
  - [x] Enable uploading of product images
  - [ ] Deployment of Auth0 resources using Terraform  required by web backend and web frontend
  - [ ] Continuous Integration workflows considering creation of Docker images and pushing them to a Docker registry
  - [ ] Continuous Deployment workflow for creating public cloud infrastructure including storage solutions and a Kubernetes cluster or deploying Kubernetes manifests to the Kubernetes cluster

**NOTE:** Also consider checking out the [entity relationship diagram](./docs/diagrams/entity-relationship-diagram.mmd)

## Getting Started

### Preconditions

- [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Auth0 instance and expertise in creating necessary resources (roles, permissions, applications, APIs).
- PayPal Developer Account with Dashboard Access. Checkout following [link](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/)

### Backend

You can find instructions on applicable commands for the backend source code in the following [README.md](./backend/Mgtt.ECom/README.md)

### Frontend

You can find instructions on applicable commands for the frontend source code in the following [README.md](./frontend/e-commerce-service/README.md)

### Local docker compose setup

**Precondition**: Update the values in [Mgtt.ECom.Web.env](./Mgtt.ECom.Web.env) and [environment.ts](./frontend/e-commerce-service/environments/environment.ts)

You can start the web front-end and back-end using the command:

```sh
docker-compose up -d --build # Optionally run this command twice if internal services are not yet up and running
``` 

To view the web backend, open a browser and go to `localhost:5000/swagger/index.html`. Results should resemble:

To view the web frontend, open a browser and go to `localhost:4200`. Results should resemble:

**TBD**

You can remove all Docker resources with:

```sh
docker-compose down -v
```
